# Unity-Game
Progress of me trying to learn how to implement various game mechanics (running, jumping, shooting, multiplayer, objectives, etc). A lot of this code was created with help from YouTube tutorials.

Essentially a game prototype (with the Unity Engine and using C# for scripts), with the basic mechanics of a multiplayer first-person shooter. Current mechanics including: shooting with raycasts, player movement, camera movement, objectives, UI, and LAN networking (using the Unity networking API, Mirror).
